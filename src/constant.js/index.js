export const HERO_CONTENT = `A decicated software developer with a knack for creating robust and scalable web applications. 
I have honed my skills in both front-end technologies such as React, HTML and CSS, as well as back-end technologies like PHP, MySQL, and Node.js. 
I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
My goal is to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact on users and businesses alike.`;

export const ABOUT_CONTENT = `I'm a Backend Developer with a strong passion for problem-solving, clean code, and turning business requirements into efficient software solutions. Holding a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from Asia Pacific University, I specialize in backend development (PHP, MySQL, APIs) while also having hands-on experience in frontend technologies like React.

What excites me most is building scalable systems that solve real-world problems. One of my proudest projects is TakaGroup, an e-commerce mobile app for Android, where I single-handedly developed the entire application and contributed to its API integration. My expertise in writing and optimizing SQL queries comes from my professional experience at IPS Software Sdn. Bhd, where I worked as a freelance/part-time developer.

I thrive in fast-paced environments, especially startups, where I can leverage my quick learning ability to adapt to new technologies and collaborate with teams to deliver impactful solutions. My approach focuses on clean, maintainable code and scalable architecture to ensure long-term success.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends and contributing to projects that challenge me to grow. My goal is to help businesses and clients build systems that perfectly fit their needs—whether that means optimizing databases, crafting APIs, or developing full-stack applications.
